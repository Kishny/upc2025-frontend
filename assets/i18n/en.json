  "about_who_p2": "The Union for Change is not a disparate grouping of candidates retained by the Constitutional Council with divergent agendas; it is a People's Coalition, open to all citizens and all political and civil organizations - including those whose candidates have been unfairly excluded - with a common goal: to win the 2025 presidential election and rebuild Cameroon during a 3 to 5 year transition period.",
  "about_roots_title": "Historical roots",
  "about_roots_p1": "UPC 2025 draws its roots from the Union for Change of 1992 which had brought the (contested) victory of the coalition candidate Ni John Fru Ndi. Since then, several federation initiatives have emerged: Front des Forces Alternatives (FFA), Stand Up for Cameroon (SUFC), Cadre Citoyen de Concertation (C3), Alliance pour la Transition et la Refondation (ATR), etc.",
  "about_roots_p2": "Learning from the past, the 'Douala Group', led by Anicet Ekane, Djeukam Tchameni and Sam Mbaka, structured the people's call to pool the forces of change, resulting in a Common Program for Transition and Refoundation and a transparent process for choosing a Consensual Candidate of the People.",

  "about_org_p2": "The basic unit is the conscious citizen who registers (online or in person), promotes the Common Program, participates in the proximity campaign of the Consensual Candidate, votes and monitors their vote - hence the slogan: 'On October 12, 2025, everything depends on me'.",
